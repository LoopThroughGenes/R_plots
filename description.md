## Collection of R plots
------------------------

During my work with clinical data, I found these plots useful. When using the ggplot library, I noticed that different plots require different ways to manually adjust labels and color grouping. Here you will find examples of these differences and how to treat them.
These plots are also useful to explore clinical data in the scenario where each patient needs to be observed individually.
For this scenario, the use of generalized mixed models is relevant, where the characteristics of each patient or sample needs to be studied individually. Here is another repository with an example of how to use GLMM in R; https://github.com/laura-valencia/Mixed_models
